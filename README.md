### Project Description
Recipe Finder is a web-based platform where users can enter a list of ingredients they have, and the system will provide recipes they can cook with those ingredients. It aims to simplify meal planning and reduce food wastage.

### The Problem Statement
How many times have you opened your fridge, stared at random ingredients, and thought, "What on Earth can I cook with this?" Recipe Finder solves that ridiculous problem by taking your ingredients and giving you recipe suggestions.

### The Solution
We built a simple yet powerful website that allows users to input a list of ingredients, and the website will fetch recipes from an API. No more guessing what to make for dinner â€” let the Recipe Finder do the hard work!
